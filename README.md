TMovies is an application that showcases top IMDb movies. By making requests to the API through Retrofit library and RxJava, it provides a comprehensive list of the top 250 IMDb movies and complete categorization of genres along with detailed information for each film.

The challenging part of this project involves sending requests to the web service, retrieving data in the desired format, and optimizing the software to achieve the desired performance with minimal requests.

Project Features:

- Sending requests to the server to fetch and display information.
- Using fragments to separate the list of movies and genres.
- Implementing ViewPager and TabLayout to create a header list for movie page.
- Using spinners to fetch and display responses based on spinner values.

The application supports both light and dark mode.
Note: This project is solely for displaying and listing top IMDb movies and does not have the capability to play or download movies.
